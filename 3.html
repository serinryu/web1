<h2> Harvard </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">Harvard University</a> is a private Ivy League research university in <strong>Cambridge</strong>, Massachusetts.

</p><p>At the most simplistic level, you can think of Wharton as the school of facts and Harvard as the school of stories. Wharton is a numbers-driven, fact-craved MBA institution. Harvard is a story-driven place, as evidenced by its near total reliance on the case study method of teaching. As J.J. Cutler, deputy dean of Wharton’s MBA Admissions and Career Services, puts it, “We are a fact-based and data-driven school. We do not have a charisma-style approach. We let the data drive us and help lead us to the solutions.”</p>
